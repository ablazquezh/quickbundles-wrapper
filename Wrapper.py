        - TODO: enrich available metrics' pool to enable metric selection. This will
        aid adequation to more problems apart from geolocated data.
        
    + automated clustering with hyperparameter tuning.
        - TODO: look for better performance metrics than silhouette (which may be
        flawing a bit). Possible 'performance metric selection' capability.
